## About

We investigate the complex ecological dynamics underlying spatial patterns and temporal dynamics across and within aquatic ecosystems. We frequently employ data-intensive approaches to synthesize diverse existing data across the globe. As a result, our projects have often created an engaging, interdisciplinary, and international network of collaborators. We are strong proponents of [open science](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/ES14-00402.1), and strive to adhere to its principles. We value collaboration, rigorous science, constructive criticism, and collegiality.
