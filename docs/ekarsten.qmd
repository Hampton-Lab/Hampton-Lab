## Bio

Eckhardt is the Lab & Data Manager for the Hampton lab at UC Davis's Department of Environmental Science and Policy.
He pursued a combined Bachelor's-Master's program as a member of the Rachael Morgan-Kiss Polar Ecophysiology lab
at Miami University of Ohio, receiving his B.A in Microbiology & Environmental Sciences in 2024 and completing his
Msc in Microbiology in 2025. For his Master's thesis, he used a molecular network approach to understand what role
mycoplankton, or aquatic parasitic fungi, may play within the perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys
in Antarctica, and what implications this may have on nutrient cycling within these enclosed systems during the polar 
night.

Eckhardt is a microbial ecologist at heart, and has had quite the adventure throughout their academic career. From studying how microbes define stream health in Appalachia as part of a BIOREU, working alongside world-class scientists 
at Pacific Northwest National Lab as a SULI intern to understand how microbes store resources under drought, to finally 
focusing on polar studies, he has gathered a breadth of experience to support the multidisciplinary work which is more 
and more critical to ecological studies. He also has experience in plankton culture maintenance, record keeping, public
speaking, field operations.

Outside of the lab, he enjoys to go hiking, rock climbing, and cooking.

He has also inherited the maintenance of this website from the previous lab manager, Braden Charles DeMattei!
