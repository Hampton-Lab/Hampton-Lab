Winter conditions are rapidly changing in temperate aquatic ecosystems, yet relatively little is known of winter ecology in these systems. However, particularly under clear ice, primary producers and consumers can be abundant in winter, and interesting dynamics occur in nutrient and carbon cycles. Winter dynamics affect not only food webs and biogeochemistry under the ice, but also processes throughout the year. These effects are especially evident in Lake Baikal where [we have worked with an international team](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/science/earth/06lake.html) for the past 18 years. In 2017, we led the [Ecology Under Lake Ice](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/workinggroups/ecology-under-lake-ice) collaboration which produced a [public data set](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF12V2D1V) and an [AGU Chapman Conference](https://connect.agu.org/aguchapmanconference/upcoming-chapmans/winter-limnology) that led to many [related publications](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)2169-8961.WINTERLIMNO) and new collaborations. A new NSF award focuses on examining annually shifting drivers and limitations on autotrophy and heterotrophy, specifically the interplay of light, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon with variation in winter severity.

Mountain lakes are of high cultural and ecological value. They can be ecologically very dynamic due to snowmelt-dominated hydrology. In recent decades, mountain regions have experienced declines in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow as well as higher warming rates for air temperature compared to their lowland counterparts. We have been working with the National Park Service to understand long term change in these special ecosystems, from [snowpack driven ecological change in plankton and biogeochemistry](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lno.12188) to increased growth of periphyton in otherwise undisturbed ecosystems.
