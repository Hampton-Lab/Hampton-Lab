Chasing down the mystery of nearshore benthic algal blooms in "blue water" lakes, our [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10357) explores broad potential for warming water to fuel blooms via releasing nutrients from sediment. The paper develops the concept and we are looking forward to testing it empirically!
