With a new semester comes a fresh set of faces! Angela Zhu, Bailey Heng, and Daniel Crownover are
the new graduate students starting this Fall and will be the first students driving aquatic research
in the Hampton lab at UC Davis. It is also when I, as the new data manager, am starting my own research 
journey with the lab. It's been exciting so far to learn about the many projects that Stephanie has had
on the backburner, and I am incredibly excited to support the lab by aiding our students or by pursuing
my own projects as well!
    Here's to this being the start of an amazing journey!
