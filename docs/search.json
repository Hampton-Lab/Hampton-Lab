    "text": "Stephanie spent the past weekend in the field at the Castle Lake Research Station in California, hosted by Sudeep Chandra (University of Nevada) and joined by colleagues from USGS, University of Utah, and Illinois State University. Together they were testing methods for measuring oxygen at the sediment-water interface, where nutrients may come out of the sediments to become more available to periphyton at night. They aim to find an inexpensive and simple means of estimating these fluxes, so that the measurements may be widely deployed!"

    "text": "Bio\nCeara is an ecosystem ecologist, who is broadly interested in quantifying and predicting the relative contributions of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to land-atmosphere carbon (C) exchange. She primarily focuses on the role of lateral C transport in linking terrestrial and aquatic C and water cycling, with an emphasis on cross-ecosystem synthesis. She uses a combination of process model and data-based approaches. Her research spans spatiotemporal scales from days to decades and watersheds to continents.\nIn 2023, Ceara received a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from the University of Notre Dame, where she developed a coupled terrestrial and aquatic C and hydrology process model, leveraged cross-ecosystem observations of C and water, and created a conceptual framework of the drivers and processes involved in LCT production in terrestrial ecosystems. In 2018, she received a M.Sc. in Environmental and Life Sciences from Trent University and her thesis research focused on the impact of flooding disturbances on aquatic biogeochemistry and ecosystem services. As an undergraduate researcher at Saint Anselm College and as an intern at Woods Hole Research Center (now Woodwell Research Center), she applied lab, field, and remote sensing approaches to answer a variety of questions related to ecological and societal consequences of climate change.\nCeara’s Google Scholar\nCeara’s GitHub"

    "text": "Bio\nRyan explores how carbon cycling in freshwater lakes and reservoirs are changing as a result of changes in land use and climate. More specifically, Ryan integrates whole ecosystem experiments, modeling, and ecological forecasting to better understand water quality and aquatic biogeochemistry. You can find more info about Ryan’s research on his website.\nRyan grew up in Michigan and spent a lot of time in the water. He moved to Montana in 2008, worked in a Freshwater Ecology lab with Dr. Wyatt Cross, and graduated with a degree in Ecology from Montana State University in 2012. Afterward, he worked on the Guppy Project in Trinidad and Tobago. In summer 2015, he joined the Carey Lab at Virginia Tech and received his PhD in 2020. He was then a postdoc at Virginia Tech and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies before joining as a postdoc in the lab of BSE Deputy Directory Stephanie Hampton. Ryan just accepted an offer with the National Ecological Observatory Network as an Aquatic Scientist."

    "text": "Bio\nStephanie Hampton’s research has progressed from basic investigations in aquatic ecology using statistical analysis of large-scale databases, to broader applications of empirical evidence in science and society. Her core expertise is in aquatic science, statistical analysis, and environmental informatics. Her research includes analyzing long-term ecological data collected from lakes as globally diverse as Lake Baikal in Siberia and Lake Washington in Seattle. Together with collaborators, she has shown how lakes respond to municipal management practices such as sewage diversion. She has also helped demonstrate the effects of climate change on plankton—the basic building blocks of aquatic food webs – with a recent emphasis on the implications of winter ice loss across the globe.\nLeadership positions in research institutions have given her an opportunity to engage in a variety of large interdisciplinary collaborations at the interface of informatics and environmental science, including those that focus on the social and technical dimensions of scientific collaboration. On every level, Hampton strives to promote data sharing, open science, and wider adoption of cutting-edge informatics for more effective and transparent environmental research. She is a leader in efforts to improve computational literacy and supports access to a robust cyberinfrastructure for everyone engaged in the environmental sciences.\nHampton joined Carnegie as Deputy Director of Carnegie’s newly launched Division of Biosphere Sciences and Engineering at the end of July 2022. She arrived from the National Science Foundation, where she was the director of the Division of Environmental Biology for 4 years. Previously she was also a professor and the former director of an interdisciplinary environmental research center at Washington State University, and deputy director of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara for 9 years. She is the 2023 President-elect of the Ecological Society of America.\nShe received her Ph.D. in ecology and evolution from Dartmouth College, a master’s degree in biology from University of Nevada Las Vegas, and a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Kansas.\nList of Publications\nFull CV (.doc)"

Our group examines ecological processes that create patterns of water availability and water quality changes at global scales and those processes that drive changes in carbon dynamics within aquatic systems, and across interfaces of water with land and atmosphere. Current work includes: recent updates to the Global Lake Area, Climate, and Population data set; examining sources of uncertainty in methane emissions from lakes; quantifying the magnitude and variation in flow of carbon across the terrestrial-aquatic interface; and the role of dissolved organic carbon in supporting aquatic food webs."

    "text": "Under Ice Ecology\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit japicoa\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter conditions are rapidly changing in temperate aquatic ecosystems, yet relatively little is known of winter ecology in these systems. However, particularly under clear ice, primary producers and consumers can be abundant in winter, and interesting dynamics occur in nutrient and carbon cycles. Winter dynamics affect not only food webs and biogeochemistry under the ice, but also processes throughout the year. These effects are especially evident in Lake Baikal where we have worked with an international team for the past 18 years. In 2017, we led the Ecology Under Lake Ice collaboration which produced a public data set and an AGU Chapman Conference that led to many related publications and new collaborations. A new NSF award focuses on examining annually shifting drivers and limitations on autotrophy and heterotrophy, specifically the interplay of light, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon with variation in winter severity."

    "text": "Mountain Lake Ecology\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit Cal Wolfe\n\n\n\n\n\nMountain lakes are of high cultural and ecological value. They can be ecologically very dynamic due to snowmelt-dominated hydrology. In recent decades, mountain regions have experienced declines in the proportion of precipitation falling as snow as well as higher warming rates for air temperature compared to their lowland counterparts. We have been working with the National Park Service to understand long term change in these special ecosystems, from snowpack driven ecological change in plankton and biogeochemistry to increased growth of periphyton in otherwise undisturbed ecosystems."

He received his B.S. in Marine Biology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019, and his MSc. with Commendation in Marine Conservation from the University of Aberdeen in 2020. In graduate school, he specialized in fisheries science, advanced statistics & modeling, and scientific communication,. For his master’s thesis, he analyzed bycatch rates in the Scottish, pelagic mixed fisheries industry, and how they affected the Scottish government’s conservation and management goals.\nBraden has performed research in lab, office, and field settings in Northern & Southern California, Scotland, & French Polynesia. Prior to working at Carnegie, Braden was in Sacramento working on California Central Valley salmon population management and habitat restoration. He also has experience in aquatic animal husbandry, water systems maintenance, basic fabrication, administrative coordination, record keeping, and public speaking.\nHe also built this website!\nBraden’s GitHub"
